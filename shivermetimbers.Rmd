  + mapped forest plots and climate stations 
  + eco-regional trending

* Lessons Learnt (personal opinions)- the platform
  + DOA outside of specific server environment (not standalone file), very slow to render
  + no provision for collaboration or version control in this version
  + needed heavy wrangling outside of software esp. for GIS
  + GUI presents a challenge to share/reproduce, requiring animated GIF captures
  + a lot of "tricking" the system required, lack of fine control and unclear parsing (overcome by training?)
