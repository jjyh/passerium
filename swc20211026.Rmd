## How to check if the pre-workshop installations were completed? (in Windows:)

### Git 

click start menu and look for "Git"; "Git Bash" should be within

or  
Right-click anywhere (usually where you want to run shell, to save changing directory location) in File Explorer or desktop and select "Git Bash Here"

### Python
Per 2:30 of the video from the carpentries, you can check that Python is present on the computer by typing below after the $ sign (confirm that the version is 3.x not 2.x)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ python --version
```

For the workshop, also check that Anaconda is present, it should be on your start menu.  Jupyter Notebook, installed as part of Anaconda, is needed for the code-along (though you have another IDE you are already familiar with for coding Python) and integrated with the note-taking Markdown format for use as a sort of lab notebook.  
We will spend the first portion of the workshop starting up + orientating Jupyter.
